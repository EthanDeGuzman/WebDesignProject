            Sligo Adventures is the leading provider of Sea, River, Lake and Safety/Rescue trips and courses in the Northwest of Ireland and beyond. We specialise in running coastal trips along the Wild Atlantic Way, especially along the stunning Mullaghmore headland coastline and Coney and Oyster Islands from Rosses Point. We have many years of experience in both sea and river kayaking, and this flexibility means we can cater for groups of any sort – from tranquil, easy sea trips on the amazing coastline of Sligo. We also offer Canoeing Ireland certified courses and assessments as well as the full range of River safety and rescue (RSR) and REC wilderness first aid courses.

            Here at Sligo Adventures we use the latest and best fleet of kayaks available: Wilderness Systems Tsunamis for sea and lake trips and Dagger GTX kayaks for the river. We also supply wetsuits, spraydecks, waterproof cags, helmets and approved buoyancy aids – everything you need for a great and comfortable day on the water.
            Overall though it’s all about fun – enjoying your time on the water with us whether that’s at the most basic or the highest levels, and we hope to send you home having had a great day with us – remember the old saying – “A bad day on the water is better than a good day in the office !”. We run some of the best tours along the Wild Atlantic Way. The scenery along the coastline in Sligo is simply stunning and its best enjoyed by kayak.
